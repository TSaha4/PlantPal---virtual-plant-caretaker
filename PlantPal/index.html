                        <strong>PlantPal</strong> is a web-based platform designed to help users identify plants and
                        access essential gardening information effortlessly. By allowing searches through both plant
                        names and images, the platform makes plant identification seamless and intuitive. Using the
                        relevant APIs, like plant.id(for image recognition), and a curated database for name-based
                        searches, the system provides detailed insights, including scientific names, watering schedules,
                        and care tips.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The project aims to encourage urban dwellers to engage in gardening by making plant care more
                        accessible. With increasing urbanization, access to green spaces has become limited, making
                        gardening a great way to reconnect with nature and relieve stress. Our platform simplifies this
                        process by offering users easy access to plant-related information to support their plant care
                        journey.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As the project evolves, we plan to expand our plant database, enhancing the accuracy and variety
                        of plant information. By combining technology with gardening, our goal is to bridge the gap
                        between people and nature, making plant care and gardening an enjoyable and informative
                        experience for everyone.

                <div class="sdg-txt">
                    <p> PlantPal supports India's Sustainable Development Goals by making plant care accessible through
                        technology. As urbanization reduces greenery and worsens air quality, our platform helps people
                        reconnect with nature, promoting environmental sustainability and urban biodiversity while
                        contributing to overall well-being.</p>
                    <h3>Supporting SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities</h3>
                    <p>SDG 11 promotes sustainable urban development. With shrinking green spaces, PlantPal encourages
                        urban gardening by providing easy access to plant care knowledge, helping create greener and
                        healthier cities.</p>

                    <h3>Aligning with SDG 13: Climate Action</h3>
                    <p>SDG 13 urges action against climate change. Plants reduce COâ‚‚ levels and improve sustainable
                        environment and lower their carbon footprint.</p>

                    <h3>Contributing to SDG 15: Life on Land</h3>
                    <p>SDG 15 focuses on biodiversity conservation. Urbanization threatens plant diversity, but PlantPal
                        helps users identify and care for plants, promoting sustainable gardening and ecosystem
                        preservation.
                    </p>
                    <p>We aim to make plant care effortless and promote sustainable urban gardening. Every plant
                        nurtured contributes to a healthier environment and a greener future.</p>
